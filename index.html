            <!--Paragraph about me-->
            <p id="hello">

                <p>Welcome to my portfolio. You're looking at the very first attempt EVER of me being a full stack
                    developer or for that matter, anything to do with coding.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For 24 years I've been doing massage therapy. I love what I do, but it is a very physical job and has
                    taken a toll on my body.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I decided to change gears into software developement because as a massage therapist, I have had to
                    problem solve my clients issues and
                    have had a creative and responsive approach depending on the guests needs. I'm also detail and rule
                    oreinted
                    as an individual. As I looked at software development, I saw the similarities and dug a little
                    deeper to understand this is a good fit for me. As I learn more from
                    bootcamp, this site will evolve and
                    hopefully so will your impressions of my work.</p>
