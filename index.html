            <!--Paragraph about me-->
            <p id="hello"></p>
            <p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer leveraging a background in entrepreneurial start-ups and hospitality to build a
                strong rapport between the technical aspect and client relations. I earned a certificate in
                Full Stack Development from the University of North Carolina- Charlotte, with newly developed skills in
                JavaScript, CSS, React.js and responsive web design. Known as a creative problem-solver passionate about
                developing apps, with a focus on mobile-first design and development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For 25 years I've either worked for a spa as a licensed massage therapist and/or I've worked for myself
                owning a spa staffing company along with owning an antique event planning business and real estate brokerage. I love what I
                do, but I've always had an interest in the technical aspect that has grown into a passion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some may think, "Wow! What a drastic change!", but really it isn't. I decided to switch gears into
                software development because as a business owner and massage therapist, I have had to
                problem solve my client's issues and
                have had a creative and responsive approach depending on their needs and what the situation demanded.
            </p>
            <p>More about what makes me tick is that I'm also detail and protocol oriented as an individual. As I looked at
                software development, I saw the similarities and dug a little
                deeper to understand that not only is this a good fit for me but it's been an underlying passion all
                along.</p>
